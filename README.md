## Description

This is a Node.js command-line application that allows users to generate a simple SVG logo by selecting a shape, providing custom colors, and entering up to three characters of text. The application demonstrates object-oriented programming principles, using shape classes and inheritance, and collects user input using the Inquirer package.

It was created as part of an Object-Oriented Programming Challenge in the Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp.
